Once upon a time, a little green leaf named Lila lived happily on a big oak tree. One windy day, a strong gust blew Lila off the tree, and she floated down to the ground. Suddenly Scared but curious, Lila decided to explore the garden around her. Along the way, she met a friendly ladybug, a busy ant, and a wise old snail who helped her find her way back home. In the end, Lila learned that even when you get lost, kindness and friends can help you find your way again.
